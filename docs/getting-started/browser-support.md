# **Browser Support**

## What Browsers Does it Support?

Look-okay works in all modern browsers. We use normalize.css for CSS resets and autoprefixer for vendor-specific prefixes to maintain compatability. Some of the newer features such as grid and flexbox may not behave well in much older browser versions.


**We do not support any version of IE.**
