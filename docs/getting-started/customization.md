# **Customization**

## Customize Variables

To customize the variables, either declare them before importing or use `@use ... with` syntax to override the defaults:

```scss
$global-prefix: "lo-";
$grid-prefix: "g-";

@import "node_modules/look-okay/src";
```

```scss
@use "node_modules/look-okay/src" with (
    $global-prefix: "lo-",
    $grid-prefix: "g-"
);
```

<div class="warn">
Using <code>@use</code> will put all variables under its own namespace, whereas <code>@import</code> will not.
</div>


## Folder Structure


## Global Settings

All settings can be found under `_settings.scss`. The settings for each individual module can be searched and detailed information 
on customizing them can be found under the page for each module.

In addition to the per-module settings, there are also a few global settings:


### Global prefix

To add a prefix to all classes generated by look-good, simply modify the `$global-prefix` variable. This can be used to avoid namespace 
conflicts.

```scss
$global-prefix: "" !default; 
```

### Variant seperator

Variants of a class (for example, `.red` might have a variant called `.hover:red`), by default are separated with a colon (`:`), but this can be changed with the `$variant-separator` variable:

```scss
$variant-separator: "\\:" !default;
```


### Use important

By default, all classes (or modules) marked with the <span class="important-badge">!important</span> tag will use 
`!important` to ensure the style is applied. If you do not desire this behavior, set `$use-important` to `false` so no 
classes will ever use `!important`:

```scss
$use-important: true !default;
```


### Blacklisted modules

If you want to create a custom build without certain modules, you can add the module name to `$blacklisted-modules` to prevent it 
from being imported (if it does get imported no classes will be generated).

```scss
$blacklisted-modules: () !default;
```
